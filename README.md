## About The Project

A GTD planner that allows you to break down large projects into small steps and progress towards full implementation without procrastination. 

The app was created by a team of developers and designers from DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT CREATORS as part of a training project.

## Inspiration for the Project

After learning about the GTD (Getting Things Done)  planning system and trying to implement it into my daily routine, I was faced with the need to often rewrite unfinished tasks into new lists, which became a big obstacle for me. I tried for several years to find a suitable application for this system that covered my needs, but couldn't find one. So, having previously developed a project hierarchy and quick to-do system based on the GTD system, I offered to make this simple and effective application to the team.
